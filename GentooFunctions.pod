=head1 NAME

Term::GentooFunctions - provides gentoo's einfo, ewarn, eerror, ebegin and eend.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Term::GentooFunctions qw(:all)

    einfo "this is kinda neat...";

    ebegin "I hope this works...";
     ....
    eend $truefalse; # the result is backwards of gentoo; ie, 0 is bad, 1 is good.

=head1 prints

einfo, ewarn, and error show informative lines

=head1 ebegin and eend

ebegin and eend show the beginning and ends of things.

Additionally, eend returns the result passed in for handy returns at the bottom of functions...

    sub eg {
        eend 0; # eg now returns a false!!  Huzzah!
    }

Lastly, eend will use $_ if it is not passed any arguments.

=head1 indents

you can also use eindent and eoutdent to show trees of things happening:

einfo "something"
eindent 
einfo "something else" # indented
eoutdent
einfo "something else (again)" # un-dented

=head1 bash

BTW, Term::GentooFunctions will use RC_INDENTATION and RC_DEFAULT_INDENT from /sbin/functions.sh...  So you can eindent in a
bash_script.sh and your perl_script.pl will use the indent level!  However, to get it to work you must 

    export RC_INDENTATION RC_DEFAULT_INDENT 
    
before you fork to perl.  Also, T::GF won't be able to modify the indent level in a way that will propagate back up to bash
(obviously).

I am using this software in my own projects...  If you find bugs, please
please please let me know. :) Actually, let me know if you find it handy at
all.  Half the fun of releasing this stuff is knowing that people use it.
