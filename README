Term::GentooFunctions
=============

Provides gentoo's einfo, ewarn, eerror, ebegin and eend.

This is not something that's in use in any Gentoo packages that
I'm aware of.  It's simply a port of Gentoo's /sbin/functions.sh
(used mainly for startup messages) to Perl for the purposes of
decorating command line apps.


use Term::GentooFunctions qw(:all)

einfo "this is kinda neat...";

ebegin "I hope this works...";

This module also provides a handy way to go do something with a
message:

my $return = edo "doing something" => sub {
    $x = 17;
};

....

eend $truefalse; # the result is backwards of gentoo; ie, 0 is bad, 1 is good.
